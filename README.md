# 24hr-Story-Feature
A simple web app to upload and view image stories like Instagram. Users can add optional captions, and stories auto-delete after 24 hours. Fully responsive with smooth UI.
# 📸 Stories Feature Clone (By Ajith)

Hey! I'm Ajith, and this is a mini project I built using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**. It's a simple clone of the "Stories" feature like we see on Instagram or WhatsApp.

## 🚀 What It Does

- Users can upload an image as a story by clicking the '+' icon.
- The uploaded image is stored in **localStorage** in Base64 format.
- Stories show up in a scrollable list at the top.
- Each story will automatically expire after 24 hours.
- Users can click on a story to **view it in fullscreen**.
- There's an **optional caption** input for each story while uploading.
- Fully responsive and works well on mobile.

## 🛠️ Tech Used

I built this using only:
- ✅ HTML
- ✅ CSS (Flexbox for layout)
- ✅ JavaScript (ES6)
- ✅ localStorage (to save stories temporarily)

No external libraries, no backend – just pure frontend!

## 💡 Why I Made This

I built this as part of a hands-on AI internship task from InstaSafe. While the original idea included AI-generated captions, I made it **manual and optional** for now.

I learned:
- How to use localStorage
- How to convert images to Base64
- Modal design using CSS and JS
- Handling expiration logic with timestamps
- DOM manipulation and responsiveness

## 🧠 Next Plans

If I get time or need to enhance it later, I might add:
- Swipe support using libraries like Swiper.js
- AI captioning using Hugging Face
- Backend to store stories in a database
- User login and personal stories
